libamdgcn is a superset of libclc.  It is intended to be a 
device library for amdgcn.  It will include device support for the 
lightning compiler, services like printf, dynamic parallelism support, 
support for ATMI, and device runtime support for OpenMP. 
The CLOC (CL Offline Compiler) requires the installation of libamdgcn.
It normally expects it to be found at /opt/rocm/libamdgcn.


Install Procedure:

dpkg -i libamdgcn*.deb

or 

rpm -i  libamdgcn*.rpm


Build Procedure:

# Download libclc git repository
mkdir -p ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone http://llvm.org/git/libclc.git

# You must install amdllvm to build libamdgcn.
# Make libamdgcn
cp -rp . /tmp/libamdgcn
cd /tmp/libamdgcn
# Review Makefile for corect location of libclc

Attention developers: To add new routines to this library, 
put the source somewhere in the lib directory hierarchy and 
add a line to the SOURCES file with the tag LIBAMDGCN. 
Lines with the tag LIBCLC are sources compiled from libclc.   

Any include files in the include directory will override
includes found in libclc.

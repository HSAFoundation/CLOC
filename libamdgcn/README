libamdgcn README file

libamdgcn is a builtin device library for amdgcn.  It is normally 
installed at /opt/rocm/libamdgcn.  It is a superset of libclc.  
The CLOC (CL Offline Compiler) requires libamdgcn.  The IBM Coral 
compiler (LLVM OpenMP 4.5) with support for amdgcn also requires 
libamdgcn.  Currently the source for libamdgcn is stored in the
libamdgcn directory of the cloc git repository.  Eventually, 
libamdgcn will be replaced with a new device library from AMD. 

Install procedure:
   dpkg -i libamdgcn*.deb
or 
   rpm -i  libamdgcn*.rpm

Build from source procedure:
- Install amdllvm
- Install python
- Assume cloc repository is in $HOME/git/cloc
   mkdir /tmp/build ; cd /tmp/build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/rocm/libamdgcn $HOME/git/cloc/libamdgcn
   make
